Log Filtering Note
==================

The server logging was changed to reduce noise. By default, only trading-related
modules log at INFO level. Everything else is set to WARN.

Modules showing INFO logs:
- polymarket_bot::services::mint_maker::runner (placements, fills, stop losses, cancellations)
- polymarket_bot::services::mint_maker::order_manager (order placement/cancellation results)
- polymarket_bot::services::mint_maker::scanner (market scan summaries)

To restore full logging, set the RUST_LOG environment variable before starting:

    set RUST_LOG=info
    cargo run --bin server

Or for debug-level:

    set RUST_LOG=debug

The filter is configured in: polymarket-bot/src/bin/server.rs (logging init block)
